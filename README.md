Recipe Management System - Cooking Assistant

This repository contains the Recipe Management System, a full-stack web application built using a Microservices Architecture. The system allows users to create, view, edit, and delete recipes, while admins can manage users and analyze application usage.

App Introduction:

The Recipe Management System is designed using a Microservices Architecture, allowing for scalability, flexibility, and better maintenance. It follows a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism, where:
Users can create, view, edit, and delete their own recipes.

Admins can manage user accounts and generate analytics reports.

Key Features:

User Authentication & Authorization (JWT-based)

Recipe Management (CRUD operations)

Smart Pantry Management (ingredient search and suggestions)

Analytics Dashboard

User Management

API Gateway for centralized microservices communication

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Technologies Used:

Vue.js for the frontend

Node.js & Express for the backend

MongoDB for the database

Axios for HTTP requests

Docker for containerization

JWT for authentication

CORS for secure API communication

Swagger for API documentation

üõ†Ô∏è Microservices Architecture

This project follows a Microservices Architecture, meaning that different functionalities are split into independent services. Each microservice runs separately and communicates through an API Gateway.

üîπ 1. User Authentication Microservice

‚úÖ Manages user login, registration, and authentication.

‚úÖ Generates JWT tokens for role-based access control (RBAC).

‚úÖ Ensures secure authentication via bcrypt.js for password hashing.

Routes:
POST /register - Register a new user , 

POST /login - Authenticate user & return JWT , 

GET /user/:id - Get user details , 

üîπ 2. Recipe Vault Microservice

‚úÖ Handles CRUD operations for recipes (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

‚úÖ Supports image uploads using Multer.

‚úÖ Allows users to manage their own recipes securely.

Routes:
POST /recipes - Add a new recipe , 

GET /recipes - Fetch all recipes , 

GET /recipes/:id - Fetch a specific recipe , 

PUT /recipes/:id - Update a recipe , 

DELETE /recipes/:id - Delete a recipe 

üîπ 3. Analytics Microservice

‚úÖ Logs recipe views and favorites.

‚úÖ Admins can generate reports on recipe usage trends.

‚úÖ Uses MongoDB for storing analytics data.

Routes:
POST /log-view - Log a recipe view , 

GET /admin/report - Generate analytics report (Admins only).

üîπ 4. User Management Microservice

‚úÖ Allows admins to view and delete users.

‚úÖ Fetches user data from Authentication Microservice.

Routes:
GET /admin/users - Get all registered users , 

DELETE /admin/user/:id - Delete a user (Admin only).

üåê API Gateway

The API Gateway acts as a centralized entry point for all microservices. It routes requests to the appropriate microservices.

‚úÖ Handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

‚úÖ Implements Rate Limiting to prevent DDoS attacks

‚úÖ Manages API Routing dynamically

Routes:
/api/auth ‚Üí User Authentication Microservice

/api/recipes ‚Üí Recipe Vault Microservice

/api/analytics ‚Üí Analytics Microservice

/api/user-management ‚Üí User Management Microservice

üì• Installation & Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Study-Program-Applied-Computer-Science/software-architecture-and-development-collablab.git

cd software-architecture-and-development-collablab

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies - 
npm install

üöÄ Running the Application

Run the following commands in separate terminals for each microservice:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start API Gateway

cd Backend/api-gateway

npm install

npm start

2Ô∏è‚É£ Start User Authentication Service

cd Backend/services/auth-service

npm install

npm start

3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Recipe Vault Service

cd Backend/services/recipe-vault

npm install

npm start

4Ô∏è‚É£ Start Analytics Service

cd Backend/services/analytics-service

npm install

npm start

5Ô∏è‚É£ Start User Management Service

cd Backend/services/user-management

npm install

npm start

6Ô∏è‚É£ Start Frontend

cd Frontend

npm install

npm run serve

7Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Application

Once all services are running, open: 
http://localhost:5006

Running the Application with Docker Compose

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Study-Program-Applied-Computer-Science/software-architecture-and-development-collablab.git

cd software-architecture-and-development-collablab

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed: Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. You can download them from Docker's official website.

Navigate to Backend/services Directory: Change the directory to Backend/services where the docker-compose.yml file is located:

cd Backend/services

Build and Start the Services: Run the following command to build and start all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file:

docker-compose up --build

Access the Application: Once all services are running, open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:5006

Stopping the Services: To stop the services, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where docker-compose is running, or use the following command:

docker-compose down

These steps will enable you to run the entire application stack using Docker Compose.
